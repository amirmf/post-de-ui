Flexbox Utility Mixins:
Mixins are reusable chunks of code in SCSS that allow you to include a block of CSS rules wherever you need them. The flexbox mixins here help generate different flexbox layout configurations with flexibility.

@mixin flex
This is the main flexbox mixin that combines flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap properties into a single mixin.
Parameters:
$direction: The direction of the flex items (row, column, etc.).
$justify: How to align items along the main axis (start, center, space-between, etc.).
$align: How to align items along the cross axis (start, center, stretch, etc.).
$wrap: Defines whether flex items should wrap (wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse).
scss
Copy code
@mixin flex($direction: row, $justify: flex-start, $align: flex-start, $wrap: nowrap) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: $direction;
  justify-content: $justify;
  align-items: $align;
  flex-wrap: $wrap;
}
@mixin flex-direction, @mixin flex-wrap, @mixin justify-content, @mixin align-items
These are smaller mixins that apply individual flexbox properties. You can use them when you need specific properties without combining them all.
Example: If you only want to set the flex-direction property, you can call @include flex-direction(row);.
@mixin flex-grow, @mixin flex-shrink, @mixin flex-basis
These mixins apply the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties that control how items grow, shrink, and their initial size within the flex container.
Example: @mixin flex-grow(1) makes the element grow to take available space.
2. Grid Utility Mixins:
@mixin grid
This is the core mixin for generating grid layouts.
Parameters:
$cols: The number of columns in the grid (defaults to 1).
$rows: The number of rows in the grid (defaults to 1).
$autoFlow: Controls how grid items are placed in the grid, whether it's by rows, columns, or dense packing (defaults to row).
scss
Copy code
@mixin grid($cols: 1, $rows: 1, $autoFlow: row) {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat($cols, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: repeat($rows, 1fr);
grid-auto-flow: $autoFlow;
}
Grid Column and Row Utilities:
.grid-cols-1, .grid-cols-2, .grid-cols-3, etc., are predefined classes for common grid column counts.
The @include grid() mixin is called with different values to set the number of columns and rows.
Example: .grid-cols-2 will create a grid with 2 columns.
Grid Auto Flow Utilities:
.grid-auto-flow-row, .grid-auto-flow-column, and .grid-auto-flow-dense apply the grid-auto-flow property, which controls how the grid items are placed when they overflow the defined grid. 3. Utility Classes (Generated by Mixins):
These classes use the mixins defined above to create reusable utility classes for various layout needs. You can add these classes to HTML elements to apply the respective styles.

Flexbox Classes:
Direction Classes:

.column, .row, .column-reverse, .row-reverse: Apply different flex directions using @include flex-direction().
Alignment Classes:

.align-start, .align-center, .align-end, .align-baseline, .align-stretch: Set the alignment of items along the cross axis using @include align-items().
Justification Classes:

.justify-start, .justify-center, .justify-end, .justify-between, .justify-around, .justify-evenly: Control the distribution of items along the main axis using @include justify-content().
Wrap Classes:

.wrap, .nowrap, .wrap-reverse: Set whether the flex items should wrap using @include flex-wrap().
Flex Grow/Shrink/Basis Classes:

.grow-0, .grow-1, .shrink-0, .shrink-1, .basis-auto, .basis-0: Control how the flex items grow, shrink, and their initial sizes using @include flex-grow(), @include flex-shrink(), and @include flex-basis().
Order Classes:

.order-first, .order-last, .order-0, .order-1, .order-2, etc.: Set the order of flex items using the order property.
Grid Classes:
Column Classes:

.grid-cols-1, .grid-cols-2, .grid-cols-3, etc., use @include grid() to set up a grid with a specific number of columns.
Auto Layout Classes:

.grid-cols-auto sets up a grid that automatically fills columns with a minimum width (using minmax()).
Row Classes:

.grid-rows-1, .grid-rows-2, .grid-rows-3: Use @include grid() to control the number of rows in the grid.
Auto Flow Classes:

.grid-auto-flow-row, .grid-auto-flow-column, .grid-auto-flow-dense: Control how grid items are placed when overflowing the grid container.

# Explanation of What I Have Provided:

- **Base Spacing Unit:** `The $spacing-unit: 4px;` defines the base unit for spacing, and the `spacing($value)` mixin scales it by multiplying the value.

**Margin Utilities:** The `m-0`, `m-1`, ..., `m-12` classes define margin for all sides, but they aren't yet defined in the `margin-sides` mixin for each value. So, we need to add a utility like this:

```scss
@for $i from 0 through 12 {
  .m-#{$i} {
    margin: spacing($i);
  }
}
```

This will generate classes `.m-0`, .`m-2`, ..., `.m-12`.

- **Margin Inline (LTR + RTL):** Similarly, `.ml-0`, `.mr-1`, etc., are defined for inline margins (left-right), and I have added the mixins `margin-rtl` to handle responsive and RTL support, but more specific classes for left and right margins are also generated like this:

```scss
@for $i from 0 through 12 {
  .m-#{$i} {
    margin: spacing($i);
  }
  .ml-#{$i} {
    margin-inline-start: spacing($i);
  }
  .mr-#{$i} {
    margin-inline-end: spacing($i);
  }
  .mt-#{$i} {
    margin-top: spacing($i);
  }
  .mb-#{$i} {
    margin-bottom: spacing($i);
  }
  .mx-#{$i} {
    margin-inline: spacing($i);
  }
  .my-#{$i} {
    margin-block: spacing($i);
  }
}
```

- **Padding Utilities:** The `.p-0`, `.p-1`, ..., `.p-12` classes are included to handle padding on all sides. Likewise, padding top (`pt-1`), bottom (`pb-1`), left (`pl-1`), right (`pr-1`), etc., are covered, but the mixin needs to be invoked to loop through the padding classes. Similar to margins, the padding utilities can be defined like this:

```scss
@for $i from 0 through 12 {
  .p-#{$i} {
    padding: spacing($i);
  }
  .pl-#{$i} {
    padding-inline-start: spacing($i);
  }
  .pr-#{$i} {
    padding-inline-end: spacing($i);
  }
  .pt-#{$i} {
    padding-top: spacing($i);
  }
  .pb-#{$i} {
    padding-bottom: spacing($i);
  }
  .px-#{$i} {
    padding-inline: spacing($i);
  }
  .py-#{$i} {
    padding-block: spacing($i);
  }
}
```

- **Gap Utilities:** I included the gap utilities `gap-1`, `gap-2`, ..., `gap-12` as well. These handle the spacing for flex and grid layouts. Again, this would loop through the `spacing` mixin for each value.

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .gap-#{$i} {
    gap: spacing($i);
  }
}
```
